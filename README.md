A local, two-pane reader and editor for a directory of markdown. Pick a file:
it's rendered on the left and editable on the right, and the left side follows
you as you type.

It reads **reader-markdown**: ordinary markdown, and a few more things for
taking notes, reviewing, teaching and presenting, such as asides in the
margin, forms to fill in, puzzles to play and decks to present. A file of it
still reads as plain text anywhere else.

## Getting started

Node 20.19+.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/jzheaux/reader && cd reader
$ npm install
$ npm link          # puts `reader` on your PATH
$ reader ~/Documents/notes
```

Opens <http://127.0.0.1:8734/>. `Ctrl-C` stops it. Nothing leaves your machine.

Then write a line starting `~` under something, and see it set in the
margin beside it:

```markdown
