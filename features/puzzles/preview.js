/**
 * Puzzles in the rendered page.
 *
 * A fence whose info string names a puzzle (```sudoku) comes from the server
 * wrapped as `<div class="puzzle" data-kind="sudoku" data-puzzle="k">`, its
 * text still inside as a code block, and is drawn here from that text. The
 * text is the whole of the puzzle's state: a move redraws the puzzle and posts
 * the new text up, and the editor writes it back into the fence, so progress
 * saves like typing and reads as plain text anywhere else.
 *
 * A puzzle whose board is kept in a file (```maze mazes/one.maze) comes with
 * that file's text in `data-source`. A kind sees the file's text and then the
 * fence's, as if they were one; it keeps the file's part as it was, and only
 * the fence's part is posted up, so the file is never written to.
 *
 * Click a puzzle (or Tab to it) to play; while it has focus it takes the
 * keys. Esc hands them back, the puzzle keeping the focus, and Enter takes
 * them again. A screen reader hears it as an application, named by its
 * kind, and hears where each key leaves it.
 *
 * A move goes up as an edit to the lines inside the fence, which the server
 * names as `data-from` and `data-to` (see edits.js), each line starting with
 * `data-prefix` for a puzzle in a quote or a list.
 *
 * What each puzzle drew is also handed back (`Preview.drawn()`), for an
 * export, which has nothing to draw them: by its kind and text, the board
 * as it stands, and the styles every board takes.
 *
 * Each kind lives in kinds/<kind>.js and registers itself here with
 * `mount(host, text, ui, post)`: draw the puzzle into `host` from `text`
 * (false if the text can't be read), keep what the reader was doing in `ui`,
 * and call `post(before, after)` with the fence's text after each move. It
 * draws through `frame`, saying what it's called and where a key leaves it.
 * Alongside, without the page, it gives `parse(text)` (its state, or null),
 * `format(state)` (the text again), `solved(state)` and the `rules` a move
 * follows, which kinds.test.js checks.
