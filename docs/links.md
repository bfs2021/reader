title: Links
---

← [Contents](index.md)

A few kinds of link are written as a name, a colon and brackets, so a
reference reads as itself in the file and links on the page. As with
emoji, the file keeps what you typed.

## Scripture

`scripture:` makes a link to Blue Letter Bible, in the RSV unless a version
follows a comma:

| You write | Links to | Shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripture:[Isaiah 2:1-5]` | `blueletterbible.org/rsv/isaiah/2/1-5` | Isaiah 2:1-5 |
| `scripture:[Isaiah 2:1-5, NIV]` | `blueletterbible.org/niv/isaiah/2/1-5` | Isaiah 2:1-5, NIV |
| `scripture:isaiah/2/1-5[plowshares]` | `blueletterbible.org/rsv/isaiah/2/1-5` | plowshares |

```
+++ Rendered

:::

References in code, and bracketed text that doesn't read as
`Book ch[:vs]`, are left as written.

`scripture-lds:` does the same for any of the standard works -- Bible, Book
of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price -- on
churchofjesuschrist.org. Books go by their full names or the usual short ones
(`1 Ne`, `D&C`, `JS—H`, `A of F`):

| You write | Links to | Shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripture-lds:[D&C 88:26]` | `…/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p26#p26` | D&C 88:26 |
| `scripture-lds:[1 Nephi 3:7]` | `…/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7` | 1 Nephi 3:7 |
| `scripture-lds:[Articles of Faith 13]` | `…/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13` | Articles of Faith 13 |
| `scripture-lds:dc/88/26[quickened]` | `…/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p26#p26` | quickened |

## RFCs

`rfc:` does the same for the RFC Editor. The brackets are required; left empty,
they read as the RFC's name:

| You write | Links to | Shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rfc:9110[]` | `rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html` | RFC 9110 |
| `rfc:9110#section-15.5[]` | `rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-15.5` | RFC 9110 §15.5 |
| `rfc:6749[OAuth 2.0]` | `rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html` | OAuth 2.0 |

```
+++ Rendered

## Searches

`search:` makes a Google search, for something to look into later. It shows
with a dotted underline and a ⌕. Spaces in the bracket become `+` in the
query, so these two are the same search:

| You write | Searches for | Shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search:[commensality]` | commensality | commensality |
| `search:[My Many Worded Term]` | My+Many+Worded+Term | My Many Worded Term |
| `search:my+many+worded+term[My Many Worded Term]` | my+many+worded+term | My Many Worded Term |

::: tabs

```
+++ Rendered

## Profiles

`linkedin:`, `bluesky:`, `gh:`, `fb:`, `insta:` and `yt:` say where to
find someone: a link to that profile, with the site's mark before it. Words
in the brackets are shown instead of the address.

| You write | Links to | Shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `linkedin:jzheaux[]` | `linkedin.com/in/jzheaux` | linkedin.com/in/jzheaux |
| `linkedin:company/vmware[]` | `linkedin.com/company/vmware` | linkedin.com/company/vmware |
| `bluesky:jzheaux[]` | `bsky.app/profile/jzheaux.bsky.social` | @jzheaux.bsky.social |
| `bluesky:jzheaux.dev[]` | `bsky.app/profile/jzheaux.dev` | @jzheaux.dev |
| `gh:jzheaux[]` | `github.com/jzheaux` | github.com/jzheaux |
| `gh:jzheaux/reader#25[]` | `github.com/jzheaux/reader/issues/25` | jzheaux/reader#25 |
| `gh:jzheaux/reader@f61f000[]` | `github.com/jzheaux/reader/commit/f61f000` | jzheaux/reader@f61f000 |

## Other files

A relative link to another markdown file opens it in reader, as a link
does on the web. Images and links in a note resolve relative to that note,
so `![](photo.jpg)` next to the file works.

```markdown
→ [Spring Security 7](spring-security-7.md)
```

## Images, on hover

A link to an image (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.avif`) shows
the image while you hover it, on a slide and in the rendered page:

```markdown
- Hi, I'm [Josh Cummings](images/bio-me.jpg)
```
