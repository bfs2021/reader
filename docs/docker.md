title: Run it in Docker

← [Contents](index.md)

A local, two-pane reader and editor for a directory of markdown: rendered on
the left, editable on the right, with asides set in a column of their own.
This image serves the directory mounted at `/docs`, for a NAS or a home
server, or to try reader without installing Node.

Source, issues and releases: <https://github.com/jzheaux/reader>.
Documentation: <https://jzheaux.github.io/reader/>.

## Run

```console
$ docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8734:8734 -v ~/notes:/docs jzheaux/reader
```

Then open <http://localhost:8734/>. `Ctrl-C` stops it.

- **`/docs`** is the directory reader serves, and writes to: saves, and its
  backups and trash in `/docs/.reader`. Without a mount it's a volume of
  Docker's own.
- **Port 8734** is the one it listens on in the container. Publish it on
  whichever port you like: `-p 127.0.0.1:9000:8734` for
  <http://localhost:9000/>. Leaving out `127.0.0.1:` publishes it on every
  address the machine has, so other devices can reach it too.
- **The user** is `node`, uid 1000, not root. A directory mounted from the
  host has to be writable by 1000, or the container run as its owner:
  `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"`.

## From another device

To reach it from other devices, publish the port on every address (`-p
8734:8734`). reader also answers only requests addressed to `localhost` or
`127.0.0.1` unless it's told the names other devices reach it by; that guards
against other web sites, not other devices. Reaching the NAS as `nas.local`,
or by its address, name each after the image:

```console
$ docker run -d --name reader -p 8734:8734 -v /volume1/notes:/docs \
    jzheaux/reader --allow-host nas.local --allow-host 192.168.1.20
```

Whatever follows the image name is added to reader's own options, so any of
them can go there; see [Install and run](https://jzheaux.github.io/reader/install.html).

There is no sign-in: whoever can reach the port can read and write `/docs`.
Keep it to a network you trust, such as your home network or a tailnet, or
put a proxy that signs people in in front of it.

## Compose

A `compose.yaml` for the same:

```yaml
services:
  reader:
    image: jzheaux/reader
    command: ["--allow-host", "nas.local"]
    ports:
      - "8734:8734"
    volumes:
      - /volume1/notes:/docs
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```console
$ docker compose up -d
```
