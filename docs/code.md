## Highlighting

A code fence is highlighted for its language (`c`, `bash`, `asciidoc`,
`js`, and the rest highlight.js knows); a fence in a language it doesn't
know, or none, is left plain.

## Picking out lines

Braces after the language pick out lines, counted from 1 inside the fence:
`{3,5-7}` makes them stand out and the rest fade, and `{numbers}` numbers
every line. Ranges separated by `|` take turns: on a slide, the first stands
out when the fence appears, and each `n` moves on to the next.

```c {numbers 2|4-5}

  printf("hi\n");
  return 0;

## Callouts

A line can carry a note, as AsciiDoc's callouts do: `<1>` at the end of
the line, after a space or in a comment of its own (`// <1>`), and the
note right after the fence. The marker becomes a numbered badge, and the
notes a list under the code; hovering a note marks its line, and the
other way round.

::: tabs

```java
numbers.stream()
  .gather(Gatherers.scan(() -> 0, Integer::sum)) <1>
  .forEach(System.out::println); // <2>
```
<1> `scan()` emits the running sum so far
<2> one line per running sum

On a slide, the code appears with none of its lines picked out, and each
`n` moves to the next callout, showing its note. Braces that pick out lines
take over the steps, and each note shows when its line first stands out.

## Output

What the code prints goes in an `output` fence right after it. It's
drawn attached under the code, tinted and bold, and a callout can mark
its lines too, with the notes after both fences.

On a slide, the output appears with the first callout in it, or as a step
of its own after the code's. Output longer than 12 lines is cut short, with
a link to show all of it; on a slide or on paper, it's whole.

## More than one language

The same code in more than one language goes in a `tabs` block; see
[Layout](layout.md).
