A `:::` block named `columns`, `tabs` or `compare` lays out what's in it.
Any other `:::` block styles it (see [Styling text](text.md)).

## Columns

A `:::` block named `columns` sets what's in it **side by side**, each
block a column, all the same width:

::: tabs
+++ Source
````markdown
::: columns
```number
15%
daily code change
```

```number
26%
weekly code change
```
:::
````
+++ Rendered
::: columns
```number
15%
daily code change
```

```number
26%
weekly code change
```
:::

- Any block can be a column: a paragraph, a list, an image, a quote, a
  fence.
- For a column of more than one block, put a `+++` line between the
  columns. Then only those lines start one.
- The other names on the line are styles for everything in it, as on any
  `:::` block: `::: columns slategray avenir-next`.
- Blocks nest: a style block in a column, or columns in a column.
- An aside written in a columns block, or right after it, sits beside all
  of it.

## Tabs

A `:::` block named `tabs` holds **more than one version** of a passage, the
same code in Java and in Kotlin, say, and shows one at a time. These pages
use it for each sample's Source and Rendered.

::: tabs
+++ Source
````markdown
::: tabs
```java
http.oauth2Login(Customizer.withDefaults());
```

```kotlin
http { oauth2Login { } }
```
:::
````
+++ Rendered
::: tabs
```java
http.oauth2Login(Customizer.withDefaults());
```

```kotlin
http { oauth2Login { } }
```

- Each block is a tab, named for its fence's language (`Java`, `Kotlin`),
  or numbered. To name tabs yourself, or give one more than a block, start
  each with a `+++` line naming it: `+++ Maven`, `+++ Gradle`.
- The first tab shows until you pick another. Picking one picks it in every
  block on the page that has a tab of that name. The pick is remembered, so
  it holds as you edit and in the next document you open; a block shows the
  tab picked most lately of those it has. Picking Gradle leaves Java or
  Kotlin as it was.
- On paper, every tab shows, one after another. In an exported file, like
  this page, each block still switches, but on its own.
- An aside written in a tab sits beside the block, shows only while that
  tab does, and marks words in it; one after the block is about all of it.

## Compare

A `:::` block named `compare` sets the versions **side by side** instead,
and marks the words they differ by, as a diff does:

::: tabs
+++ Source
```markdown
::: compare
+++ Draft
The service retries a failed request three times before giving up
+++ Final
The service retries each failed request up to three times, then gives up
:::
```
+++ Rendered
::: compare
+++ Draft
The service retries a failed request three times before giving up
+++ Final
The service retries each failed request up to three times, then gives up
:::
:::

- Click a version's name to compare the others against it. Its words that
  another version lacks are tinted red, and the other versions' words that
  it lacks green. The first is compared against until you pick another, and
  the pick is shared and remembered as a tab's is.
- Words are compared without regard to case or punctuation. Code is
  compared too, apart from the text and as written: a name, a number or
  each mark of punctuation is a word.

## Callouts

A blockquote that opens with `[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`,
`[!WARNING]` or `[!CAUTION]` becomes a box headed with 📝 💡 ❗ ⚠️ or 🛑, as
on GitHub.

::: tabs
+++ Source
```markdown
> [!TIP]
> Go slow; it's sweeter.

> [!WARNING]
> my information
```
+++ Rendered
> [!TIP]
> Go slow; it's sweeter.

> [!WARNING]
> my information
:::

## Number badges

A numbered list written `1)` in place of `1.` has its numbers drawn as
badges, as a code fence's callouts are. It's still a numbered list on
GitHub.

::: tabs
+++ Source
```markdown
1) Clone the repo
2) Run `npm install`
```
+++ Rendered
1) Clone the repo
2) Run `npm install`
:::

With boxes, a `1)` list is steps to follow; see [Recipes](recipes.md).

## Tables

Pipe tables, with `:---:` and `---:` for alignment, as on GitHub.

::: tabs
+++ Source
```markdown
| Day | Talks |
| --- | ---: |
| Saturday | 12 |
| Sunday | 9 |
```
+++ Rendered
| Day | Talks |
| --- | ---: |
| Saturday | 12 |
| Sunday | 9 |
